# What is innovation?

We have all heard the word innovation tossed around.
What is innovation? Who is allowed to innovate?
And my favorite, why does it matter?
The simplest definition of innovate is “to make
changes in something established”. Why innovate?
Necessity is the mother of invention. In the context
of business, this means that innovation is
the need for constant improvement and introduction
of new ideas, methods, and products to fulfill a
need or solve a problem. A more harch way of saying it is
“Innovate or die”.

Innovation is the driver
of industry, our industry is the cornerstone of
this community, and this community influences our
culture. Working in a thriving culture is more exciting,
fullfilling, and rewarding than just working in a job.

Imagine being given the authority to make real
change. Change that influences the future of our
lives for the better. Change that not only makes your
life more fulfilling but also the lives of those around
you. CoFound hereby gives you the
authority to innovate. Congratulations! Now follow
the simple principles of IDEA because only you are
perfectly equipped to bring constant improvement
to your ideas, methods, and products.

#### IDENTIFY

Look for something that is established. Watch for
trigger phrases like, “Because we have always
done it that way”.

#### DEFINE

Outline the need. Make it clear so that you can
step back and see how it affects the bigger picture.
Be able to easily articulate the need.

#### EXPERIMENT

Come up with multiple solutions for the problem,
test those solutions, and pick the one the is the
most effective.

#### ACCELERATE

Figure out how to recreate the solution so that you
can share it with others then share the solution.
