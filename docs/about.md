#### wait stop, please... way too much jargon. How about we break it down a little.

# Finding the not obvious

We spend an incredible amount of our effort paying attention to things that are not obvious. Our mindset is to not focus on the why not or how not, but how a solution can possibly win. This forces us to rely on things like our imagination and creativity to seek out a path that is not readily easy to accommodate or acquire. This approach demands that we develope tools that currently do not exist primarily the **"startup culture"**.

### Startups = Growth

What exactly is a **"startup culture"**? A startup is simply a business with one key distinction, high growth potential. Startups are formed by merging entrepreneurs with new ideas. Generally we refer to them as founders. Founders are men or women who have created something new or have found a new way of thinking about an old problem. The **startup culture** is a highly intention approach towards developing an environment to encourage and develope founders.

### Why High Growth

We have identified two problems in the Grand Island community. The the lack of custom solution providers and the scarcity of potential jobs for future generations in technology. We know that high growth companies have a strong dependency on technology. If CoFound can encourage a thriving environment for custom solution providers we will see the continued growth of the opportunities and capabilities of this community.

###### The Capacity Gap

The _"lack of custom solution providers"_ we like to call the "Capacity Gap". Companies in Grand Island area have grown to the size that they now demand custom solutions to problems. However Grand Island currently does not have a strong ecosystem of custom software and hardware solution providers forcing companies to look out side of the Grand Island area to fill there unique needs.

###### The Workforce Gap

The _"scarcity of technology jobs"_, Grand Island's more urgent need we call the "Workforce Gap". Grand Island has invested an incredible amount of resources and time into educating the next generations of future tech and entrepreneur types, however with little opportunities locally a large portion of them are forced to move out of the Grand Island area or even worse move on, giving up on their dreams of working in those fields.
