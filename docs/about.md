# About CoFound

#### _"CoFound exists to developing a startup culture in Grand Island and the surrounding area. The primary vehicles we are using to accomplish this is developing a community of startups, entrepreneurs, and tech minded types along with forming a mentor network of local businesses while providing a guided path to success."_

#### Wait, stop please... way too much jargon. How about we break it down a little.

# Finding the NOT obvious

We spend an incredible amount of our effort paying attention to things that are not obvious. Our mindset is to not focus on the why not or how not, but how a solution can possibly win. This forces us to rely on things like our imagination and creativity to seek out a path that is not readily easy to accommodate or acquire. This approach demands that we develope tools that currently do not exist, primarily the **"startup culture"**.

### Startups = Growth

What exactly is a **"startup culture"**? A startup is simply a business with one key distinction... a high growth potential. Startups are formed by merging entrepreneurs with new ideas. Generally, we refer to them as founders. Founders are men or women who have created something new or have found a new way of thinking about an old problem. The **startup culture** is a highly intentional approach towards developing an environment to encourage and create founders.

### Why High Growth?

We have identified two problems in the Grand Island community. The the lack of custom solution providers and the scarcity of potential jobs for future generations in technology. We know that high growth companies have a strong dependency on technology. If CoFound can encourage a thriving environment for custom solution providers, we will see the continued growth of the opportunities and capabilities of this community.

###### The Capacity Gap

The lack of custom solution providers is what we call the "Capacity Gap". Companies in Grand Island area have grown to the size that they now demand custom solutions to problems. However, Grand Island currently does not have a strong ecosystem of custom software and hardware solution providers forcing companies to look outside of the Grand Island area to fill their unique needs.

###### The Workforce Gap

Grand Island's more urgent problem is the scarcity of technology jobs, we call this the "Workforce Gap". Grand Island has invested an incredible amount of resources and time into educating the next generations of future tech and entrepreneur types. However, with little opportunities locally, a large portion of these future innovators are forced to move out of the Grand Island area or worse, move on, giving up on their dreams of working in those fields.

# The Community

CoFound very intentionally resides inside The Hedde building downtown. This beautiful old building has been transformed into The Hedde Collective. The Hedde Collective is a co-working space specially designed for entrepreneurs and startups.

# The Network

CoFound already has a growing network work of partners and mentors.
